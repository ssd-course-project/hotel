```
Start your virtual environment by running :
```bash
  $ source venv/bin/activate # For linux 
  venv\Scripts\activate # For Windows
```
Then you can install all the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You have to create local_settings.py according to the template **local_settings.example.py**

After that install required node modules
```bash
npm install
```

And finally create database and run the server
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
